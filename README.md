# Morality System
 
The Morality System is designed around a simple role-playing themed video game where the player travels from village to village, investigating the villagers for information to aid the player's search for their brother.
This morality system is unique in that it is designed as a Black Box Morality System which does not reveal the player's moral alignment or the choice's morality value to the player.
Instead, the Black Box Morality System utilizes narrative to reveal the moralilty of the player and of their choices.

# Requirements
The Morality System was created in Unity version 2022.3.9f1 and Visual Studio Code version 1.84.2.
