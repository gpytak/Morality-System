  dialogue:
  - Well, well, well, look who it is. How are you doing, brother?
  - What are you doing this far home, anyways? How'd you find me?
  - I asked around. They described someone who looked like me passing through their
    village and gave me directions.
  - Well, you managed to find me. It's good to see you again, brother.
  - Yeah, you too.
